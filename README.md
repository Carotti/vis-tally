- 10/02/18: Nothing too important to report. I found a team. Nice people. Douglas, a halfling bard, from the realm of Hurstpoint. I must say, he baffles me. He spends his time singing, and wandering the land. He does walk in a funny way. Feet angled like a sextant. Probably because he wanders too much. He left us early. He said he had some business to clear up. Probably some dark stuff he doesn't want to tell us about. I'll watch him closely. But you see, you can always trust a man with angled flappers. That's one thing my father taught me. The other, a gnome from the Brocken. He speaks fast and generally holds a confused face. He seems to have good intentions. He said he's off on a big trip to Amerika if he makes it out of this alive. We probably won't. We camped out at his hut in the old fort of general H. Ammersmith and delegated tasks. Team moral is on a high. I'll keep an eye on the bard, but trust the gnome.
